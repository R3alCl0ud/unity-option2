September 9: Watched one video as a group on Lynda. Kevin showed us the intro parts of the Unity development engine. I ordered the text
book that will be used for our class. Since Unity can use Python, I am wondering if some of the more simple functions can be written in Python.
Python was my first coding language and I know it best only second to Java.
